Objective: A Sentiment Analyzer in C++ is a tool that determines whether a given text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. It consists of several key components, starting with text preprocessing, which involves cleaning input text by removing punctuation, tokenizing words, and performing stemming or lemmatization. Next, feature extraction converts textual data into numerical representations using techniques like Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or word embeddings. The system may use a sentiment lexicon, a dictionary of words mapped to sentiment scores, or a machine learning model like Na√Øve Bayes or Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify sentiment based on labeled training data. The sentiment scoring mechanism then aggregates word scores to determine the overall sentiment of the input. A simple C++ implementation loads a predefined sentiment dictionary, tokenizes user input, calculates the sentiment score by summing up word values, and classifies the text accordingly. Enhancements could include expanding the lexicon, implementing more advanced NLP techniques, or integrating machine learning and deep learning models via TensorFlow C++ API for improved accuracy.
